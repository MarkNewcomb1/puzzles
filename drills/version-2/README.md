## Einstein's Riddle

There is a row of five different color houses. Each house is occupied by a person of different nationality. Each person has a different pet, prefers a different drink, and smokes different brand of cigarettes.

* The Brit lives in the Red house.
* The Swede keeps dogs as pets.
* The Dane drinks tea.
* The Green house is next to the White house, on the left.
* The owner of the Green house drinks coffee.
* The person who smokes Pall Mall rears birds.
* The owner of the Yellow house smokes Dunhill.
* The person living in the centre house drinks milk.

## Solution

I start by drawing the houses with their colors. 

-- Norwegian--  -- Blue --  -- Red, Brit --  -- Swede, dogs --  -- Dane, tea -- -- Yellow, Dunhill --  -- Green, Coffee --  -- White --

The German smokes Prince, and the person who keeps horses lives next to the person who smokes Dunhill. The person who smokes Dunhill lives in the yellow house. Well, the Dane lives next to the yellow house, so he must smoke Blends and keeps horses, and drinks tea.


Eventually, through a lot of whiteboard drawing and erasing, the different clues from the different pieces of information lead to the German having the fish, as the German was the only one left that didn't have a pet after the other clues fell into place. 

Who has fish at home? The German.
