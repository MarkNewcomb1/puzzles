## Solution

I start with each statement and fill in what I can. Each couple has their own sentence that states their first and last names, their employment, their car, their favorite color, and the book they own - in that order. Since not all information is known about each couple at once, I fill in what I can and leave blanks where there is missing information.

Mr. and Mrs. Black both work as Shop-Assistants, drive a _ car, have _ as their favorite color, and own _ book.

I notice that the unnamed couple with the unnamed occupation, a named car, a named favorite color, and unnamed book match up perfectly with the named couple, named occupation, unnamed car, unnamed favorite color, and a named book. They are the only two data points when, matched together, perfectly fill up each other's pieces of missing information. 

So take these two points together:

Mr. and Mrs. Cermak both work as Ticket Collectors, drive a Dacia, have a favorite color violet, and own Shed Stoat. 

Same with the Agriculturalists: It's Stan and Hannah Horricks, who work as Agriculturalists, drive a Moskic, have a favorite color white, and own Dame Commissar. Again, it's a matter of matching the holes with the known knowledge of somewhere else. 

So in the end we have:

Mr. Mathew Black and Mrs. Black both work as Shop-Assistants, drive a Trabant, have pink as their favorite color, and own Mulatka Gabriela (borrowed We Were Five). 
Mr. and Mrs. Zajac both work as Accountants, drive a Fiat, have red as their favorite color, and own "The Seadog". (borrowed Shed Stoat).
Owen and Victoria Kuril both work as Doctors, drive a Skoda, have brown as their favorite color, and own The Modern Comedy. (borrowed Slovacko Judge)
Stan Horricks and Hannah Horricks both work as Agriculturalists, drive a Moskic, have a favorite color white, and own Dame Commissar. (borrowed Mulatka Gabriela)
Robert Smith and Jenny Smith both work as Warehouse Managers, drive a Wartburg, have yellow as their favorite color, and own We Were Five (borrowed the Modern Comedy). 
Alexander and Monica Cermak both work as Ticket Collectors, drive a Dacia, have violet as their favorite color, and own Shed Stoat (borrowed Grandfather Joseph). 
Paul and Pamela Swain both work as shoppers, drive a Renault, have green as their favorite color, and own Grandfather Joseph. (borrowed The Seadog)
