## Goat, Cabbage, Wolf

A farmer returns from the market, where he bought a she-goat, a cabbage and a wolf (what a crazy market :-). On the way home he must cross a river. His boat is small and won't fit more than one of his purchases. He cannot leave the she-goat alone with the cabbage (because the she-goat would eat it), nor he can leave the she-goat alone with the wolf (because the she-goat would be eaten).

How can the farmer get everything on the other side in this puzzle?

The biggest mental hurdle for this problem is assuming that you can't move things back and forth, because unloading items from a market only once, from one side to another, is how people normally unload groceries. Because of the special circumstances of these items, though, it requires moving things more than once. 

Once that mental hurdle is jumped over, really this one came to me fairly easily: Leave the two things that are ok to be left alone on one side - the wolf and the cabbage. Therefore, this means to send only the goat to the other side of the river. Return to the original side of the river where the wolf and cabbage are, take only the cabbage to the other side, leaving only the wolf on the original side. Once the other side is reached, leave the cabbage but take the goat again. Return to the original side, drop off the goat but take the wolf. On the other side, now it has the wolf and the cabbage. Those two items may be safely left alone while you go back to the original side for the goat, and take the goat with you to the other side, where the wolf and cabbage are. Done.
